    Class to provide tools to interact with reference catalog
    in Butler repository and select pieces of the catalog
    that cover the sky area of a pointing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boresightRa : float
        Boresight RA in degrees.
    boresightDec : float
        Boresight Dec in degrees.
    boresightRotAng : float
        Boresight rotation angle in degreees.

        Get the htmIds for the pieces of the reference catalog

        identifying hierarchical triangular mesh (HTM) shards that
        are used to store the reference catalogs in gen3 butler
        repositories in more easily accessible pieces.

        ----------
        radius : float, optional
            Radius in degrees of the pointing footprint.
