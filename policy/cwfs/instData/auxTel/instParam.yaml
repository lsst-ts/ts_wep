# Auxiliary telescope parameters:

# Obscuration (inner_radius / outer_radius of primary mirror)
obscuration: 0.3525

# Focal length in m
focalLength: 21.6

# Aperture diameter in m
apertureDiameter: 1.2

# Move the M2 to fake the move of focal plane dz
# Move the M2 by 0.8 mm = move the focal plane by 0.0205 m
# Defocal distance offset in m
offset:
  0.8mm: 2.05e-2

# Camera pixel size in m
pixelSize: 14.4e-6
