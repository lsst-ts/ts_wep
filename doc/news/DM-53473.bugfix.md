* Simplify CalcZernikesNeuralTask `_updateAverageRowWithAggregatedZernikes()` to
  query average row by label instead of assuming index position for better
  robustness.
* Fix CalcZernikesNeuralTask to correctly handle 2D `aggregatedZernikes` array
  from TARTS by extracting the first row.
* Set intrinsic and deviation columns to NaN for all rows in neural task output
  since the neural task does not use intrinsic Zernike tables.
